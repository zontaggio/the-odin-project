This is the first project of "The Odin Project" full-stack developer course. The challenge is to create a pure HTML5 page without CSS or JS to show some food recipes. I decided to choose weird foods to make it more interesting. Obviously, ChatGPT helped me a lot on the ingredients and steps, lol!

Notes for improvement:

* Practice more about relative and absolute path hyperlinks.
